Machine learning-based mapping of tea plantations using satellite imagery to support agricultural statistics and spatial planning.

🍃 Automated Tea Plantation Mapping Using Machine Learning
Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based workflow for mapping tea plantations from satellite imagery. The objective is to support agricultural statistics, monitoring, and spatial planning through automated and reproducible geospatial analytics.

The model achieved over 90% classification accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning applied to Earth observation data.

Problem Statement

Manual mapping of tea plantations is time-consuming and difficult to update regularly. There is a need for automated, scalable methods that can generate reliable plantation maps using satellite imagery.

Methodology

The workflow includes:

Satellite image preprocessing

Feature extraction (spectral and spatial features)

Training a supervised machine learning model

Model evaluation and accuracy assessment

Spatial inference and map generation

Tools & Technologies

Python

Machine Learning (Random Forest / ML classifiers)

Remote Sensing

GIS & Earth Observation

Raster processing

Results

Achieved 90%+ classification accuracy

Generated GIS-ready plantation maps

Supported agricultural monitoring and planning workflows

(Sample outputs and maps are provided in the results folder.)

Data Availability

Due to data size and licensing restrictions, raw satellite imagery is not included in this repository.
The repository focuses on methodology, code, and reproducibility.
